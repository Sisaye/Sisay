    <div id="mainhead"><h1>THE FOURTH PETITION
       <br> “Give us this day our daily bread.”</h1></div>
       <div id="part1">Here, now, we consider the poor bread basket, the necessaries 
        of our body and of the temporal life. It is a brief and simple 
        word, but it has a very wide scope. For when you mention and 
        pray for daily bread, you pray for everything that is necessary in 
        order to have and enjoy daily bread and, on the other hand, 
        against everything which interferes with it. Therefore you must 
        open wide and extend your thoughts not only to the oven or 
        the flour-bin, but to the distant field and the entire land, which 
        bears and brings to us daily bread and every sort of sustenance. 
        For if God did not cause it to grow, and bless and preserve it in 
        the field, we could never take bread from the oven or have any 
        to set upon the table.
        To comprise it briefly, this petition includes everything that 
        belongs to our entire life in the world, because on that account 
        alone do we need daily bread. Now for our life it is not only 
        necessary that our body have food and covering and other 
        necessaries, but also that we spend our days in peace and quiet 
        among the people with whom we live and have intercourse in 
        daily business and conversation and all sorts of doings, in short, 
        whatever pertains both to the domestic and to the neighborly 
        or civil relation and government. For where these two things are 
        hindered [intercepted and disturbed] that they do not prosper 
        as they ought, the necessaries of life also are impeded, so that 
        ultimately life cannot be maintained. <p></p></div>

        <div id="h2"><h1>THE FIFTH PETITION
           <br> “And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive 
            those who trespass against us.”</h1></div>
            <div id="part2"><p>This part now relates to our poor miserable life, which, although 
                we have and believe the Word of God, and do and submit to 
                His will, and are supported by His gifts and blessings, is 
                nevertheless not without sin. For we still stumble daily and 
                transgress because we live in the world among men who do us 
                much harm and give us cause for impatience, anger, revenge, 
                etc. Besides, we have Satan at our back, who sets upon us on 
                every side, and fights (as we have heard) against all the 
                foregoing petitions, so that it is not possible always to stand firm 
                in such a persistent conflict.
                Therefore there is here again great need to call upon God and 
                to pray: Dear Father, forgive us our trespasses. Not as though 
                He did not forgive sin without and even before our prayer (for 
                He has given us the Gospel, in which is pure forgiveness before 
                we prayed or ever thought about it). But this is to the intent that 
                we may recognize and accept such forgiveness. For since the 
                flesh in which we daily live is of such a nature that it neither 
                trusts nor believes God, and is ever active in evil lusts and 
                devices, so that we sin daily in word and deed, by commission 
                and omission, by which the conscience is thrown into unrest, so 
                that it is afraid of the wrath and displeasure of God, and thus 
                loses the comfort and confidence derived from the Gospel;
                therefore it is ceaselessly necessary that we run hither and 
                obtain consolation to comfort the conscience again.</p></div>
