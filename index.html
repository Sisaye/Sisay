    <div id="mainhead"><h1>THE LORD’S PRAYER AN INTRODUCTION</h1></div>
    <div id="part1"><p>We have now heard what we must do [in the Ten 
        Commandments] and believe [in the Apostles’ Creed], in 
        which things the best and happiest life consists. Now follows 
        the third part, how we ought to pray. For since we are so 
        situated that no man can perfectly keep the Ten 
        Commandments, even though he have begun to believe, 
        and since the devil with all his power, together with the 
        world and our own flesh, resists our endeavors, nothing is 
        so necessary as that we should continually resort to the ear 
        of God, call upon Him, and pray to Him, that He would give, 
        preserve, and increase in us faith and the fulfilment of the 
        Ten Commandments, and that He would remove 
        everything that is in our way and opposes us therein.  But 
        that we might know what and how to pray, our Lord Christ 
        has Himself taught us both the mode and the words, as we 
        shall see. But before we explain the Lord's Prayer part by part, it is 
        most necessary first to exhort and incite people to prayer, 
        as Christ and the apostles also have done. And the first 
        matter is to know that it is our duty to pray because of God's 
        commandment. For thus we heard in the Second 
        Commandment: Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord, 
        thy God, in vain, that we are there required to praise that 
        holy name, and call upon it in every need, or to pray. For to 
        LORD, TEACH US TO PRAY call upon the name of God is nothing else than to 
        pray. Prayer is therefore as strictly and earnestly 
        commanded as all other commandments: to have no other 
        God, not to kill, not to steal, etc. Let no one think that it is 
        all the same whether he pray or not, as vulgar people do, 
        who grope in such delusion and ask, “Why should I pray? 
        Who knows whether God heeds or will hear my prayer? If I 
        do not pray, someone else will.” And thus they fall into the 
        habit of never praying, and frame a pretext, as though we 
        taught that there is no duty or need of prayer, because we 
        reject false and hypocritical prayers.</p></div>

        <div id="h2"><h2>THE FIRST PETITION <br>“Hallowed be Thy name.”</h2></div>
        <div id="part2"><p>This is, indeed, somewhat obscure, and not expressed in good 
            German, for in our mother-tongue we would say: Heavenly 
            Father, help that by all means Thy name may be holy. But what 
            is it to pray that His name may be holy? Is it not holy already? 
            Answer: Yes, it is always holy in its nature, but in our use it is not 
            holy. For God's name was given us when we became Christians 
            and were baptized, so that we are called children of God and 
            have the Sacraments, by which He so incorporates us in Himself 
            that everything which is God's must serve for our use.
            Here now the great need exists for which we ought to be most 
            concerned, that this name have its proper honor, be esteemed 
            holy and sublime as the greatest treasure and sanctuary that we 
            have; and that as godly children we pray that the name of God, 
            which is already holy in heaven, may also be and remain holy 
            with us upon earth and in all the world.
            But how does it become holy among us? Answer, as plainly as 
            it can be said: When both our doctrine and life are godly and 
            Christian. For since in this prayer we call God our Father, it is 
            our duty always to deport and demean ourselves as godly 
            children, that He may not receive shame, but honor and praise 
            from us. </p></div>
