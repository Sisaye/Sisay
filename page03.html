    <div id="mainhead"><h1>THE SIXTH PETITION
        <br>“And lead us not into temptation.”</h1></div>
        <div id="part1"><p>We have now heard enough what toil and labor is required to 
            retain all that for which we pray, and to persevere therein, 
            which, however, is not achieved without infirmities and 
            stumbling. Besides, although we have received forgiveness and 
            a good conscience and are entirely acquitted, yet is our life of 
            such a nature that one stands to-day and tomorrow falls. 
            Therefore, even though we be godly now and stand before God 
            with a good conscience, we must pray again that He would not 
            suffer us to relapse and yield to trials and temptations.
            Temptation, however, or (as our Saxons in olden times used to 
            call it) Bekoerunge, is of three kinds, namely, of the flesh, of the 
            world, and of the devil. For in the flesh we dwell and carry the 
            old Adam about our neck, who exerts himself and incites us 
            daily to inchastity, laziness, gluttony and drunkenness, avarice 
            and deception, to defraud our neighbor and to overcharge him, 
            and, in short, to all manner of evil lusts which cleave to us by 
            nature, and to which we are incited by the society, example and 
            what we hear and see of other people, which often wound and 
            inflame even an innocent heart.
            Next comes the world, which offends us in word and deed, and 
            impels us to anger, and impatience. In short, there is nothing 
            but hatred and envy, enmity, violence and wrong, 
            unfaithfulness, vengeance, cursing, raillery, slander, pride and 
            haughtiness, with superfluous finery, honor, fame, and power, 
            where no one is willing to be the least, but everyone desires to 
            sit at the head and to be seen before all.
            Then comes the devil, inciting and provoking in all directions, 
            but especially agitating matters that concern the conscience 
            and spiritual affairs, namely, to induce us to  despise and 
            disregard both the Word and works of God, to tear us away 
            from faith, hope, and love, and bring us into misbelief, false 
            security, and obduracy, or, on the other hand, to despair, denial 
            of God, blasphemy, and innumerable other shocking things. 
            These are indeed snares and nets, yea, real fiery darts which are 
            shot most venomously into the heart, not by flesh and blood, 
            but by the devil.</p></div>
            <img src="08.jpg">
            <div id="h2"><h2>THE SEVENTH PETITION
               <br> “But deliver us from evil. Amen.”</h2></div>
               <div id="part2"><p>In the Greek text this petition reads thus: Deliver or preserve us 
                from the Evil One, or the Malicious One; and it looks as if He 
                were speaking of the devil, as though He would comprehend 
                everything in one, so that the entire substance of all our prayer 
                is directed against our chief enemy. For it is he who hinders 
                among us everything that we pray for: the name or honor of 
                God, God's kingdom and will, our daily bread, a cheerful good 
                conscience, etc.
                Therefore we finally sum it all up and say: Dear Father, pray, 
                help that we be rid of all these calamities. But there is 
                nevertheless also included whatever evil may happen to us 
                under the devil's kingdom-poverty, shame, death, and, in short, 
                all the agonizing misery and heartache of which there is such 
                an unnumbered multitude on the earth. For since the devil is 
                not only a liar, but also a murderer, he constantly seeks our life, 
                and wreaks his anger whenever he can afflict our bodies with 
                misfortune and harm. Hence it comes that he often breaks 
                men's necks or drives them to insanity, drowns some, and 
                incites many to commit suicide, and to many other terrible 
                calamities. Therefore there is nothing for us to do upon earth 
                but to pray against this arch-enemy without ceasing. For unless 
                God preserved us, we would not be safe from him even for an 
                hour. </p></div>
